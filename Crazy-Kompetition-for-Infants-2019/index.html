      <h2>Crazy Kompetition for Infants</h2>
      <p>
        Crazy Kompetition for Infants (CKI) is an annual event that raises money for the Pediatric Trauma Program (PTP) through a series of fun, competitive mini-games. As the first District event of the new academic year, Crazy Komp allows new members their first chance to meet so many different people while giving returning members an opportunity to reconnect with old friends. Form teams within your home club or division and compete against other teams to be the last one standing! Crazy Komp will let you tap into your inner child and release your competitive spirit so sign up with your home club to find out if you have what it takes to come out on top!
        <br />
        <br />
        For the first time ever, the District Finance and Fundraising Committee is proud to bring this event online and as one single event for the entire district!

      <h2>Pediatric Trauma Program</h2>
      <p>
        The Pediatric Trauma Program is a charity established by the Kiwanis Cal-Nev-Ha Foundation in 1994 which focuses on the need for education and training in pediatric trauma and injury prevention. The purpose of the program is to develop local service projects to educate people of childrenâ€™s safety to decrease the number of children who are severely injured or killed due to traumatic unintentional injuries. Funds raised are used to purchase safety equipment, provide proper training to medical staff, and support projects created by our six partner hospitals.

                We recommend reaching out to your home club and division (eg. by posting on FB pages or asking around during general meetings or DCMs) if you are struggling to find a complete team. However, incomplete teams are still welcome -- we will combine incomplete teams the day of the event!

                Yes! This also applies to incomplete teams that do not have six members. Simply list the members that lack a team (or incomplete teams) in one of the team registrations and submit their waivers and registration fees. The Finance and Fundraising Committee will then combine all incomplete teams and individual players the day of the event to maximize the number of people participating.

                Yes! Teams do not need to be comprised of all members from just one school. Bond with your fellow Circle K-ers! Just make sure to have each member submit registration through their respective school and to indicate on the registration form that they are on a team comprised of members from different schools.

                In previous years, clubs reserved spots for members by listing "Member 1/2/etc." on the registration form and paying early registration prices for those spots. As members express interest in Crazy Komp and sign up,
                they are able to take one of those reserved spots. Then, the day of  the event, a club representative (eg. Club President or Treasurer) can check in and present a list of finalized teams and member names. If you find
                that you cannot fill all the spots you reserved with your club members, you can advertise to your division to fill them in!

    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <div class="container-fluid margins">
      <div class="col-sm-6 left-side">
        <h2>Do members need to be dues-paid to attend?</h2>
        <span>
          No. All attendees must either be (1) dues-paid members of Kiwanis or Circle K; (2) </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prospective Circle K-ers</span><span> who are currently enrolled at an institution where a chartered or chartering club is located; or (3) given explicit permission from District Administrator Mondo Velazquez to attend.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Who needs to sign a waiver?</h2>
        <p>
          ALL interested members MUST sign a waiver. This includes participants, judges, spectators, and on-site medics. Early Registration participants should mail in waivers along with the Early Registration document and check though you are allowed to submit waivers on-site as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How many people are in a team? How many males and females?</h2>
        <p>
          There is a maximum of six members per team with the option of one alternate player. There is no specific gender ratio.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How many teams can my club register?</h2>
        <p>
          Your club may register as many teams as they wish! Simply copy and paste more tables in the Registration Word Doc to register more teams.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Can clubs register with incomplete teams?</h2>
        <p>
          We recommend reaching out to your home club and division (eg. by posting on FB pages or asking around during general meetings or DCMs) if you are struggling to find a complete team. However, incomplete teams are still welcome -- we will combine incomplete teams on-site!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Can members sign up to be individuals competitors?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! This also applies to incomplete teams that do not have six members. Simply list the members that lack a team (or incomplete teams) in one of the team registrations and submit their waivers and registration fees. The Finance and Fundraising Committee will then combine all incomplete teams and individual players onsite to maximize the number of people participating.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Will lunch be provided?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! Lunch is provided with registration; we will also offer vegan and vegetarian options for those who are interested. Snacks and water will be provided during the day to keep your energy levels high!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 right-side">
        <h2>Can I be on a team with people from other schools?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! Teams do not need to be comprised of all members from just one school. Bond with your fellow Circle K-ers! Just make sure to have each member submit registration through their respective school and to indicate on the registration form that they are on a team comprised of members from different schools.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What if I want to go to Crazy Kompetition but donâ€™t want to compete?</h2>
        <p>
          We have three options for those who wish to attend but not participate: (1) <a href="http://tinyurl.com/CrazyKomp19JSM">sign up to be a judge</a>! Judges earn service hours for their time in helping the games run smoothly or (2) be a spectator. Cheer on your teams for moral support and show CNH Circle K the passion you have for this event!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Can clubs make changes to their teams after they have submitted registration?</h2>
        <p>
          We understand that quarter schools only have a few weeks to advertise Crazy Komp to their members, so we will allow for team switches to happen on-site. However, we request that a club representative (eg. Club President or Treasurer) provide a list of all finalized teams and members in attendance on-site.

        <h2>How does parking work?</h2>
        <p>
          For both CKI North & South, there is free parking around the park! Be sure to get there early if you want a closer spot.
